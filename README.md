## ‚ö° How It Works

1. **User asks a question** (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening in Limerick?‚Äù or ‚ÄúIs a river-view room available?‚Äù).
2. **AI agent responds** with up-to-date info or room availability.
3. **Booking request:** User books a room via chat.
4. **Workflow:** Lambda functions check inventory, process bookings, and trigger email notifications.
